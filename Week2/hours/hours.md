## Hours 

### Learning Goals
1. Practice using arrays 
2. Using an array as a parameter of a function 
3. Adding values in a loop 
4. Integer Division and Type Casting 

### Background 
Suppose you’re taking CS50 (if you’re reading this you probably are!) and spending time every week on each problem set. You may be wondering how many hours you’ve spent learning computer science, 
on average or in total! In this program, you’ll complete a function that 
calculates, based on a user’s input, a total number of hours or an average 
number of hours across a given number of days.

### Getting Started 
1. Log into code.cs50.io using your GitHub account.
2. Click inside the terminal window and execute ```cd```.
3. At the ```$``` prompt, type ```mkdir hours```
4. ```cd hours``` 
5. Then copy and paste wget https://cdn.cs50.net/2022/fall/labs/2/hours.c into your terminal to download this lab’s distribution code.
6. You are to complete the function, ```calc_hours```, which calculates both total hours and average hours, depending on the value of ```output```.

### Implementation Details 
The ```main``` function prompts the user for the number of weeks a user has been taking CS50, 
then creates an array with as many elements. Notice that, after retrieving some data, 
the program prompts the user to type in either “T” or “A”—”T” should (but doesn’t yet!) print the total 
number of hours the user entered, while “A” should (but doesn’t yet!) print the average hours the user entered. 
Notice that the ```do while``` loop uses ```toupper``` to capitalize the letter that’s input 
before it is saved in the variable ```output```. Then, the ```printf``` function calls 
```calc_hours```. Note the syntax involved when passing an array to a function.

To complete ```calc_hours```, first total up the hours saved in the array into a new variable. Then, depending on the value of ```output```, return either this sum, or the average number of hours.



### Thought Question 
What is the advantage of using a function to calculate hours?

### How to Test Your Code 

```
hours/ $ ./hours
Number of weeks taking CS50: 3
Week 0 HW Hours: 3
Week 1 HW Hours: 7
Week 2 HW Hours: 10
Enter T for total hours, A for average hours per week: A
6.7 hours
```

```
hours/ $ ./hours
Number of weeks taking CS50: 2
Week 0 HW Hours: 2
Week 1 HW Hours: 8
Enter T for total hours, A for average hours per week: T
10.0 hours
```

You can check your code using ```check50```, a program that CS50 will use to test your code when you submit, by typing in the following at the $ prompt. But be sure to test it yourself as well!
```check50 cs50/labs/2022/fall/hours```

To evaluate that the style of your code, type in the following at the ```$``` prompt.
```style50 hours.c```

### How to Submit 
No need to submit. This is just an optional practice problem completed with your lab!
